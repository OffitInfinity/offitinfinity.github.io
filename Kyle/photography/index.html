            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Photography has always been one of my on/off hobbies, wherein all of my cameras have been hand-me-downs from my grandfather. Though I've shot many photos on my iPhones over the years, their capabilities never satisfied the way a real kit did. Much of my photography not shot on iPhone makes extensive use of my kit's zoom capabilities. <br>
                While I started out mostly focused around pictures documenting various trips across my high school career, I grew a bit more artistic throughout college. Across my later years I grew an intrest towards film digitization. A byproduct of digging through family photos, following the deaths of my father and grandmothers in 2024. <br>
                <!-- While visiting my father when he was in the hospital I would stay at the family farm in what was once my great grandparents' bedroom. Unknowing of how the next month would play-out, I brought my suit with me to store in the closet. Sadly both closets were a mess, so I tried to clean one. While cleaning I came across three things: A print of the USS New Jersey on the wall in the back, my great grandmother's high school and college year books, and a collection of family photos which probably hadn't seen the light of day since my great grandmother's funeral, 7 years ago. New Jersey was amusing to me as I had bought the same print visiting her in Camden a few years prior. The years books gave details of the Socialite Chemist I called my great grandmother. The photos though gave much more. Family albums of my great grandfather's parents and siblings, portrait of my great grandmother's mother, who died when she was young. Later on while relaxing, I found a treasure trove: my great grandfather's collection of slide. Hundreds of old Kodachrome film slides he used to show off. --></p>

            <h2> Cameras I've Shot On </h2>
                <h3> Cannon EOS Rebel 5 </h3>
                    <p> My first proper camera, it was given to me by my grandfather to use during my trip to Hershey, Pennsylvannia. From there it became my primary camera for my later years of high school, seeing use during my trip to Disney. </p>
                    <h3> Nikon D5500 </h3>
                    <p> My current primary camera. I had used it temporarily, borrowing it for during a visit to East Harbor State Park. I hadn't used it again until recently to which it got intertwined in a reinvigorated intrest in photography and travel. </p>
                <!-- List iPhones -->
                <h3> iPhones </h3>
                    <h4> iPod Touch </h4>
                        <p> Not exactly my first camera, as I had started out with a few point and shot film cameras as well as my earlier flip cell phones, the iPod Touch is my first camera I still have pictures from. My first hand-me-down from my grandfather, not given as a camera but a replacement for my iPod nano, it was my primary camera throughout high school, being relegated to point and shot in my later years.
                    <h4> iPhone XR </h4>
                        <p> My first proper iPhone, I bought it in 2019. It would be my main camera from then until I upgraded to the 12 mini in 2021. It's short time would see a few park visits as well as pictures taken at work, such as those of a toad that was regulary near our storage shed.
                    <h4> iPhone 12 mini </h4>
                        <p> My current iPhone, also my longest used camera and phone. I bought it in 2021 expecting the mini line-up to be a one-off. This phone would be my main camera for a trip across the US East Coast and another trip to the DC area for a cousin's wedding.</p>
